# QA Coach Operation Protocol

> Canonical index: `docs/INDEX.md`

This document defines how I (QA Coach) will operate to minimize errors and maximize transparency during complex operations.

## Overview

**Goal:** Prevent silent failures and network errors from disrupting workflow. Every operation is visible, recoverable, and has fallback strategies.

**Principle:** Transparency > Speed. I will always tell you what I'm doing, how it's going, and what to expect.

---

## Pre-Operation Protocol

**Precondition:** Do not proceed unless the approved Requirements Brief (Requirements Analyst), Design Spec (Designer, lightweight), and Implementation Spec (Architect) are available. If missing or ambiguous, stop and request them.

### Component Skeleton Creation Guidelines

When creating test specs for new components, **always create component skeletons first** to enable full test implementation:

**Required files for Stencil components:**

- `component-name.tsx` — Component skeleton with @Props, @State, render() method
- `component-name.scss` — Basic styling structure
- `readme.md` — Component documentation
- **Component-specific utilities/services** — Place in the component's folder (e.g., `components/app-icon/utils/`, `components/app-icon/services/`)

**Skeleton structure example:**

```typescript
import { Component, Host, h, Prop, State } from '@stencil/core'

@Component({
  tag: 'app-component',
  styleUrl: 'app-component.scss',
  shadow: true,
})
export class AppComponent {
  @Prop() propName!: string
  @State() stateName: string | null = null

  // TODO: Implement lifecycle methods
  // TODO: Implement business logic

  render() {
    return (
      <Host>
        <div class="component-wrapper">
          {/* TODO: Implement template */}
        </div>
      </Host>
    )
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Tests can import the component immediately (no lint errors)
- Full test implementations can be written up front
- Component structure guides implementation
- No need to stub imports or use empty component arrays

**File organization:**

- Shared utilities → `libs/ui-components/src/utils/`
- Component-specific utilities → `libs/ui-components/src/components/component-name/utils/`
- Component-specific services → `libs/ui-components/src/components/component-name/services/`

### Step 1: Operation Briefing

Before attempting ANY operation with >3 steps or modifying >1 file, I will provide:

```
🔹 OPERATION: [Operation Name]
📋 SCOPE: [What files/changes]
📊 COMPLEXITY: Simple / Medium / Complex
⏱️ ESTIMATED TIME: [X-Y seconds of actual work]

PLAN:
  Strategy 1 (Primary): [How I'll do it]
  Fallback 1: [If primary fails]
  Fallback 2: [If fallback 1 fails]
  Fallback 3: [If fallback 2 fails]

PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS:
  ✓ Check: File readable/writable
  ✓ Check: Pattern counts match expectations
  ✓ Check: No syntax errors

Ready? [I proceed unless you signal STOP/WAIT/CONSTRAINTS]
```

### Step 2: Pre-Flight Verification

Before starting, I verify:

- Target file(s) exist and are readable
- Expected patterns are present in correct quantities
- File structure is valid (braces balanced, syntax sound)
- No concurrent modifications detected

If any check fails, I **STOP** and report before proceeding.

---

## Execution Protocol

### During Operation: Real-Time Reporting

**For each logical step/batch**, I report in this format:

```
📍 STEP N/TOTAL: [Operation Description]
   Attempt: [Strategy name]

   [Operation executes]

   ✓ SUCCESS: [What changed] (N replacements/changes)
   OR
   ⚠️ PARTIAL: [What succeeded, what didn't]
   OR
   ✗ FAILED: [Error type] - [Reason]
      → FALLBACK: Switching to [Strategy name]
```

**Example output:**

```
📍 STEP 1/3: Mobile Drawer Interaction tests
   Attempt: multi_replace_string_in_file (6 tests at once)

   ✓ SUCCESS: All 6 tests replaced (6/6 patterns matched)

📍 STEP 2/3: Desktop Navigation tests
   Attempt: multi_replace_string_in_file (3 tests at once)

   ✗ FAILED: JSON parse error at position 1234
      → FALLBACK: Switching to individual replace_string_in_file calls

   ✓ SUCCESS (Fallback): All 3 tests replaced (3/3 individual calls)

📍 STEP 3/3: Verification
   ✓ SUCCESS: spec-verify.sh confirms 31/31 tests present, 0 TODOs
```

### Checkpoints for Large Operations

For operations modifying **>10 elements**, I use checkpoints:

```
CHECKPOINT 1/3 (Tests 1-10)
  ✓ Tests 1-5 SUCCESS
  ✓ Tests 6-10 SUCCESS
  → Checkpoint validated, proceeding

CHECKPOINT 2/3 (Tests 11-20)
  ✓ Tests 11-15 SUCCESS
  ⚠️ Test 16 FAILED → Fallback to individual replacement
  ✓ Test 16 retry SUCCESS
  ✓ Tests 17-20 SUCCESS
  → Checkpoint validated, proceeding

CHECKPOINT 3/3 (Tests 21-31)
  ✓ All tests SUCCESS
  → FINAL VERIFICATION: spec-verify.sh
  ✓ All 31/31 tests confirmed
```

---

## Failure Recovery Protocol

### Failure Detection

I detect failures by:

1. **Tool error responses** — Clear error in output
2. **Pattern mismatch** — Expected pattern not found in file after operation
3. **Verification failure** — Post-operation verification shows incomplete state

### Recovery Strategy (Automatic)

When a step fails:

1. **Attempt primary strategy** ← We are here
2. **If fails** → Switch to Fallback 1 (usually: break into smaller chunks)
3. **If fails** → Switch to Fallback 2 (usually: file rewrite or different approach)
4. **If fails** → Report to you with: what failed, why, what we can try

Example:

```
✗ FAILED: multi_replace_string_in_file (too many complex replacements)
   → Fallback 1: Break into 3 smaller batches

   ✓ Batch 1/3 SUCCESS
   ✓ Batch 2/3 SUCCESS
   ✓ Batch 3/3 SUCCESS

   ✓ RECOVERY COMPLETE: All changes applied successfully
```

### When You Intervene

If automatic recovery fails after 2 fallbacks, I will:

```
⚠️ RECOVERY FAILED after 2 fallback attempts
   Last attempt: [What I tried]
   Error: [Specific error]

OPTIONS:
  1. Wait and retry (network may be temporary)
  2. Use different approach: [What I suggest]
  3. Break work into smaller chunks
  4. Skip this operation for now

What would you like to do?
```

---

## Post-Operation Protocol

### Step 1: Verification

After every operation, I verify immediately:

- Run relevant verification script (`spec-verify.sh`, etc.)
- Check file structure (braces, syntax)
- Confirm expected patterns are present

### Step 2: Summary Report

```
✅ OPERATION COMPLETE

📊 RESULTS:
   ✓ 31/31 tests implemented
   ✓ 0 orphaned TODOs
   ✓ All braces balanced
   ✓ File syntax valid

⏱️ EXECUTION SUMMARY:
   Step 1: SUCCESS (6 tests)
   Step 2: SUCCESS + FALLBACK (3 tests, switched strategies)
   Step 3: VERIFICATION SUCCESS

📝 TOTAL CHANGES: 9 files modified, 47 replacements, 0 failures

Ready for next step → [Proceed to drawer unit tests]
```

### Step 3: Git Status Check

For file-modifying operations, I verify:

- Files modified (expected count)
- No unintended deletions
- Ready to commit/review

---

## Special Cases

### Network Errors

If I detect network connectivity issues:

```
⚠️ NETWORK ERROR DETECTED
   Last operation: [What I was doing]
   Error: [Timeout/connection reset/etc]

   Options:
   1. Retry immediately
   2. Wait 5 seconds and retry
   3. Break into smaller operations

   Automatically retrying in 3 seconds...
```

### Partial Failures

If some changes succeed and some fail:

```
⚠️ PARTIAL FAILURE (6/10 changes applied)

   ✓ Applied: Tests 1-5
   ✗ Failed: Tests 6-10 (JSON parse error)

   Current state: Inconsistent (6 tests done, 10 pending)

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Undo partial changes with git checkout
   - Try again with smaller batches
   - OR keep partial state and fix 6-10 separately
```

### Timeout Scenarios

If operations take longer than expected:

```
⏳ OPERATION TIMEOUT
   Expected: <5 seconds
   Actual: >30 seconds

   Likely cause: Network latency or large file operation

   Continuing... (will abort if >60 seconds)
```

---

## Your Role (Minimal Intervention)

**You only need to:**

1. **Before operations:** Say "Go" or give constraints
   - "Use file rewrite only"
   - "Break into batches"
   - "Wait, I need to check something first"

2. **During operations:** Monitor my output (optional)
   - I'll tell you if something goes wrong
   - No action needed from you unless I ask

3. **If something fails:** Tell me which option you prefer
   - "Try again"
   - "Use different approach"
   - "Skip for now"

**I will never** silently retry or make decisions without your input if automatic recovery fails.

## Integration with TDD Workflow

This protocol supports the established workflow:

- **QA Coach** (me): Writes tests with this protocol
- **Reviewer**: Evaluates test specs once complete
- **Developer**: Implements when specs are approved

Each phase is clear, verifiable, and recoverable.

---

## Monitoring for Quality

Throughout operations, I monitor:

✅ **Correctness** — Do changes match the spec?
✅ **Completeness** — Are all intended changes applied?
✅ **Consistency** — Does file state match expectations?
✅ **Recoverability** — Can we revert/retry if needed?

If any metric fails, I pause and report before continuing.
