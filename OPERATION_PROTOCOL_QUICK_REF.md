## Verification Scripts

Anytime, run:

```bash
./spec-verify.sh              # Check all specs
./spec-verify.sh e2e         # E2E tests only
./spec-verify.sh drawer      # Drawer tests only

./pre-flight-check.sh <file> <pattern1> <pattern2>
```

## Standard Responses to You

**"Go"** → Proceed with operation
**"Wait"** → Pause before starting (you'll verify something)
**"Use [approach] only"** → Constraint on how I do it
**"Break into batches"** → Smaller chunks instead of all at once
**"Try again"** → Retry after failure
**"Skip"** → Don't do this operation now

---

## Your Role (TL;DR)

1. **Before:** Approve with "Go" or give constraints
2. **During:** I handle all steps and fallbacks (no action)
3. **After:** Next step is clear and ready
4. **If fails:** Choose from specific options I offer

**No more:** "Try again" with no context, silent failures, repeated errors
